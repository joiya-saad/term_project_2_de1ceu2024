# Requirements

- To run the project there are two additional packages that are required in KNIME:

1. KNIME Database:
https://hub.knime.com/knime/extensions/org.knime.features.database/latest

2. Python Script:
https://hub.knime.com/knime/extensions/org.knime.features.python3.scripting/latest/org.knime.python3.scripting.nodes2.script.PythonScriptNodeFactory

The packages may be installed by dragging the icon from the website to the KNIME window.

- The data accessed through AWS cloud with the following credentials:
Host name:  project2.cv408kmm0zzs.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306
Username: admin
Password: admin123

# Workflow description

- [Data part â€” @Saad]

- File 'data2.csv' is stored in the data folder that is located in the project folder and is referenced locally;

- String replacer node is used to correct the country names, so that they look the same in both tables in order to properly join them (Slovak Repiblic -> Slovakia, Russian Federation -> Russia amendments are made in the data2);

- Then, an HTML query from a wikipedia webpage ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes ), and a Python script that processes the response is used to get a table of country names and 2-letter country codes in ISO 3166-1 A-2 format, as needed for Eurostat API;

- The three data sources are merged by year by country, so that all the data appears in one table;

- Then, four Eurostat APIs are collected and integrated into data: pollution level, HousePrice-to-Income ratio, mobile internet usage, and population. The API requests are generated by string manipulation with year and country code. Data sources:
